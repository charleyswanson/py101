** a function that returns the sum of two numbers

Get two numbers from user
Add numbers together
Print the sum

    START

    GET num1 and num2
    SET answer = num1 + num2

    PRINT answer

__________

** a function that takes a list of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Set a variable = an empty string
Iterate through strings in the list
For each string in the list, append to the new string/variable
Print the new string

    START

    SET list = list of strings
    SET new_string = ''
    SET iterator = 0

    WHILE iterator < length of list
        SET new_string = new_string + list[iterator]

        iterator = iterator + 1

    PRINT new_string

__________

** a function that takes a list of integers, and returns a new list with every other element from the original list, starting with the first element. For instance:

every_other([1,4,7,2,5]) # => [1,7,5]

Create a new, empty list
Iterate through every other item in the original list
Append the current item to the new list
Print the new list

    SET new_list = []
    SET iterator = 0

    WHILE iterator < length of original list
        SET new_list = new_list.append(original list[iterator])

        iterator = iterator + 2

__________

** a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return None.

Create a counter variable to keep track of instances of given character
Iterate through the given string and check each character against the given one
When a match is found, add one to the counter variable
When the counter variable reaches 3, return the index
If the counter doesn't reach 3, return None

    SET iterator = 0
    SET counter = 0

    WHILE iterator < length of string
        IF counter < 2
            IF char == string[iterator]
                counter = counter + 1
        ELIF counter = 2
            IF char == string[iterator]
                PRINT iterator

    PRINT None

__________

** a function that takes two lists of numbers and returns the result of merging the lists. The elements of the first list should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned list, while the elements of the second list should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:

merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

Create a new list
Iterate through each of the two given lists
Add an element from each of the given lists to the new list

    SET iterator = 0
    SET new_list = []

    WHILE iterator < length of list1
        SET new_list = new_list.append(list1[iterator])
        SET new_list = new_list.append(list2[iterator])

PRINT new_list
